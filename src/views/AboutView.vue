      The goal of this project is to provide a studying platform that's free and as easy to use for
      my friends. It shouldn't cost you money to flip through flashcards on the bus or in the hall
      when you're study material is at home. By adding three sided cards and spaced repitition
      we have a system that's guarenteed to make you ace that test.

      The second goal is gain some experience in Vue3 and implementing a project methodically. 
      Leveraging all my skill sets and making a clean open source project with common sense commits,
      scoped tasks, competitor research and taking notes scientific literature on the topic.
